    <h2>Mathematics</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>No more memorizing equations and getting lost in the mathematical
      forest. We start from the ground up, building a solid foundation where
      everything is logical and motivated. New topics are built
      atop this foundation, so you're always on solid mathematical ground.
      Get ready for some "aha" moments!</p>
      <p>Pre-Algebra, Algebra 1, Algebra 2, Geometry, Math Analysis, Trigonometry,
      Pre-Calculus, Statistics, Calculus, Differential Equations, Linear Algebra,
      Math 1, Math 2, Math 3</p>
    </div>

    <div class="subject">
      <h2>Physics</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>The study of how this universe works. It's easy for new students of the
      subject to get bogged down by symbols and equations. By drawing the right
      pictures, analyzing units, and thinking about reasonable outcomes, we will
      shift the focus from the equations to the physical phenomena they are meant
      to describe.</p>
      <p>AP Physics, Introductory Physics, Astronomy, Electricity and Magnetism</p>

    <div class="subject">
      <h2>Chemistry</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>High school chemisty isn't all lighting things on fire and mixing
      substances in beakers. It also requires you to internalize the atomic
      perspective. That is, it forces you to look at the world as an
      unfathomably large number of incredibly tiny objects and their
      interactions with one another. I have helped many students gain
      this perspective and given them all the tools they need to succeed
      in this class.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="subject">
      <h2>SAT/ACT</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>An entrance requirement for many colleges and universities.
      I help students achieve their dream score by creating a study
      plan, drilling practice problems, and teaching them tricks to
      optimize time and guessing. Using these strategies, many of
      my students far surpass their own expectations </p>
    </div>

    <div class="subject">
      <h2>SSAT/ISEE/HSPT</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>The entrance exams for private high schools. For many students,
      this will be their first major testing experience, and that can
      be pretty stressful. Nothing helps to alleviate that anxiety and stress
      more than feeling prepared. I have a lot of experience teaching these
      tests and helping students become confident and knowledgable about them.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="subject">
      <h2>AP/SAT Subject Tests</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>For ambitious students, these tests can be taken for college credit.
      With college tuition at an all time high, getting some courses out of the
      way early can help cut costs. They don't look too bad on a resume either.</p>
      <p>AP Calculus AB, AP Calculus BC, AP Statistics, AP Chemistry,
      AP Physics 1, AP Physics 2, AP Physics C, SAT Math 1,
      SAT Math 2, SAT Physics, SAT Chemistry</p>
